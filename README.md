## 📍 Overview

The PEZ Server Monitor is a system information tool that allows users to retrieve various types of information about their system. It offers functionalities to gather CPU details, memory information, disk space usage, network activity, process status, container information, and system statistics such as OS type, uptime, and hostname. The tool provides a robust and succinct overview of the system's performance, enabling users to monitor and troubleshoot any potential issues efficiently.

## ⚙️ Features

| Feature                | Description                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **⚙️ Architecture**     | The codebase follows a modular architecture where different components are organized into separate files. Each file focuses on a specific aspect of system monitoring, such as disk info, network info, process info, etc. The main.py file acts as the entry point and orchestrates the retrieval and display of different types of information based on user input. The use of modules allows for easy maintainability and extensibility of the system. |
| **📖 Documentation**   | The codebase lacks comprehensive documentation. While each file has brief comments explaining their purpose, there is no centralized documentation that provides an overview of the system, its components, and how to use it. This makes it challenging for new developers to understand and contribute to the project. |
| **🔗 Dependencies**    | The codebase relies on several external libraries, including `psutil`, `tabulate`, `yaml`, and `subprocess`. These libraries are used for various tasks such as retrieving system information, formatting data, parsing configuration files, and executing shell commands. The use of these libraries enhances the functionality of the system and makes it easier to work with system-level data. |
| **🧩 Modularity**      | The codebase demonstrates good modularity by separating different functionalities into separate files. Each file focuses on a specific aspect of system monitoring and can be easily swapped or extended without affecting other parts of the system. This modularity allows for easier maintenance, testing, and customization of the monitoring tool. However, there could be further improvements by organizing related files into directories or modules to provide better organization and reduce potential naming conflicts. |
| **✔️ Testing**          | The codebase does not include any tests. Lack of tests makes it difficult to ensure the correctness and stability of the functionality provided by the system. Implementing a testing strategy, such as unit tests or integration tests, would greatly improve the reliability and maintainability of the codebase. |
| **⚡️ Performance**      | The codebase utilizes efficient libraries like `psutil` and `subprocess` to gather system information, reducing the impact on performance. However, without any benchmarking or profiling data, it is challenging to assess the overall performance of the system. Regular monitoring and optimization of resource usage, such as reducing unnecessary system calls or optimizing data retrieval, can further enhance the performance of the tool. |
| **🔐 Security**        | The codebase does not address security directly, as it primarily focuses on system monitoring. However, it is worth noting that the codebase relies on external libraries and system commands. Proper validation and sanitization of inputs, as well as implementing secure communication channels when interacting with external systems, should be considered to ensure the security of the monitoring tool and the systems it interacts with. |
| **🔀 Version Control** | The codebase is stored on
